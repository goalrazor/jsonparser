        <message>"Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke
            Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are
            powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally
            powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's
            life.
            With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which
            will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant
            confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift:
            these two droids."
