    "message": "\"Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke\n                Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are\n                powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally\n                powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's\n                life.\n                With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which\n                will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant\n                confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift:\n                these two droids.\""
